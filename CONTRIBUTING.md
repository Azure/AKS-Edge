This project welcomes contributions and suggestions. Most contributions require you to agree to a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) declaring that you have the right to, and actually do, grant us the rights to use your contribution. For details, visit https://cla.opensource.microsoft.com.

Samples are direct from the feature teams and we welcome your input on issues and suggestions for new samples. If you would like to see new coverage or have feedback, please consider contributing. You can edit the existing content, add new content, or simply create new issues. Weâ€™ll take a look at your suggestions and will work together to incorporate them into the docs.

> **Note**:
> When contributing, make sure you are contributing from a **develop** branch with clear branch naming and description of the PR. Your contribution will not be accepted if your PR is coming from the master branch and has no clear guidance.

When you submit a pull request, a CLA bot will automatically determine whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately (e.g., status check, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the bot. You will only need to do this once across all repos using our CLA.

This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments.
