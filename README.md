## Bug Guidance

Bug reports filed on this repository should follow the default issue template that is shown when opening a new issue. At a bare minimum, issues reported on this repository must:

1. **Be reproducible outside of the current cluster**

    If you file an issue requiring direct access to your cluster and/or Azure resources, you will be redirected to open an Azure support ticket. Microsoft employees may not ask for personal / subscription information on GitHub.

1. **Contain the following information**
    1. **A good title**: Clear, relevant, and descriptive - so that a general idea of the problem can be grasped immediately
    1. **Description**: Before you go into the detail of steps to replicate the issue, you need a brief description. Assume that whoever is reading the report is unfamiliar with the issue/system in question
    1. **Clear, concise steps to replicate the issue outside your specific cluster**.These should let anyone clearly see what you did to see the problem and allow them to recreate it easily. This section should also include results - both expected and actual - along with relevant URLs.
    1. **Be sure to include any supporting information you might have that could aid the developers**. This includes YAML files/deployments, scripts to reproduce, exact commands used, screenshots, etc.
