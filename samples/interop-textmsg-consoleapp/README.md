# Interop Windows Console App with AKS Edge Linux container

## Introduction
This sample demonstrates bidirectional communication between a Windows console application and a Linux container running inside the AKS edge cluster. 

The underlying communication between the Windows console application and the Linux container is based on [Mosquitto Broker](https://mosquitto.org/), an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. 

### Mosquitto Broker
To establish a bi-directional communication between the Windows companion app and a Linux container, this sample code uses Mosquitto broker running as a container inside the AKS edge cluster. All communication is done using MQTT pub/sub protocol. There are different Mosquitto container options already packaged and published. For this tutorial, we'll use the [Mosquitto broker packaged by Eclipse](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto). However, the user can build and package their own version.

### Windows Companion Application
The Windows console application in this sample uses the [MQTTNet]https://github.com/dotnet/MQTTnet) package and [.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/whats-new/dotnet-6) to publish and subscribe to messages using the MQTT broker. In this scenario, the Windows console application is being implemented as a *companion app* that runs side-by-side with a Linux container. 

The Windows console application, doesn't require to authenticate with the Mosquitto broker instance, running as a container inside the AKS edge cluster. If needed, authentication using certificates or username/password can also be configured. For more information about certificates usage, see [Mosquitto - Authentication methods](https://mosquitto.org/documentation/authentication-methods/). 

### Linux container 
This sample also incorporates a Linux container, which processes messages sent by the *console app* then sends processed results back to the *console app* to be displayed on the console output.

### Message Routing
This sample employs concepts described in [MQTT Producer/Suscriber](https://mqtt.org/) to establish message flow between the *companion app* (Windows console application) and a custom AKS edge Linux container. 

The [topic table](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#topicconfigs) below defines a set of topic entries, where each entry defines a message routing between the two endpoints. 

To realize this communication model for the development of both the Windows application and Linux container, we use the below topics:  

<center>

| Companion app (Console App) | Message Direction | Linux container |
|-------------------|:-----------:|-------------|
| **(1) Produce** - This method will send a user defined message to the Kafka broker to the topic defined by the *PUBLISH_TOPIC* env variable. If variable isn't defined, the user will have to provide the publishing topic. | ðŸ Š ðŸ Š ðŸ Š | **ConsumeMessage** - This method receives a message from the companion app and trigger a response back to the companion app. Using the **ProduceMessage** method, the Linux container answers back a modified version of the original message. | 
| **(2) Consume** - This method will subscribe to Kafka topic defined by the *SUBSCRIBE_TOPIC* env variable. If variable isn't defined, the user will have to provide the subscribe topic. | ðŸ ˆ ðŸ ˆ ðŸ ˆ | If the **ProduceMessage** is invoked, it will send a message to the topic defined by the *PUBLISH_TOPIC* env variable. |
